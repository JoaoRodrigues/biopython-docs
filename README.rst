Automatically generated Biopython documentation
===============================================

This is currently an experiement.

The idea is that code changes on https://github.com/biopython/biopython
already undergo continutous integration testing, and one of those jobs
will render the latest documentation, and for the master branch, push
it to this separate https://github.com/biopython/docs/ repository from
where it can be automatically published using github pages.

The intention is to use https://biopython.org/docs/dev/ for the latest
master branch, with ``/dev/`` replaced with the version for releases.

We would not expect or intend to edit the documentation directly in
this repository.
